# Tab Redirector

Tab Redirector is a Chrome extension that redirects you to an existing tab if you try to open a new tab with the same top-level domain (e.g., `example.com`). This extension helps prevent the creation of duplicate tabs, keeping your browsing experience organized and clutter-free.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, it will automatically start monitoring new tab creations. If you attempt to open a new tab with a URL that has the same top-level domain as an existing tab, the extension will redirect you to the existing tab instead of creating a new one.
